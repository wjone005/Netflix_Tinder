# InstaFlix - 'Tinder/Instagram' for Netflix üçø

A Flask app that generates random movie recommendations, with details listed for each title, that a user can swipe through and watch with the click of a button.

## Installation
1. Install Requirements 

    ```$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3)```

2. Obtain an API Key for OMDB, Google, and Facebook. Set the keys as an environment variable
    Using the following format for macOS and Linux Distributions:

    ```
    export KEY=value
    export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
    export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
    export FB_CLIENT_ID=FB_CLIENT_ID
    export FB_CLIENT_SECRETD=FB_CLIENT_SECRET
    export api_key=api_key
    
    ```

    and add them with the following format `KEY = environ.get("value")`

    If you are ever adding your own code to GitHub and choose to use a `.env` file, make sure it's listed under a `.gitignore` file. Therefore, it doesn't accidently get published to GitHub!=

3. Download the CSV linked in [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) and name the file `catalog.csv`. This will store the bulk of our data.

## Usage
#### To launch the app:
    $ python application.py or python3 application.py

Once the Flask app is running, navigate to the `localhost` link provided:
